<h2>Skills</h2>
This overview section of my skills is really just a quick summary so that someone will know at a glance what type of projects I have worked on. 
You might think of this as a calling card.

<h2>My projects</h2> 
The **Projects section** is the bread and butter of this page (it's raison d'etre, if you will). I created a single place where I could collect all my projects and give someone a good impression with screenshots, screenvideos, links, and descriptions.

## I'll be updating the page as often as I can remember and leave a **last updated** timestamp in the footer.
