  My Gatsby Personal Page

<h2>Portfolio for my projects </h2> 
  
On this page I create a single place to collect and display my projects in a portfolio and share them with those who are interested. 


<h2>Skill development</h2>
Although the primary intention of this page is to display my projects, I also keep track of new skills, programming interests, and technologies here.

## I'll be updating the page monthly and add projects and new features as they arise.
